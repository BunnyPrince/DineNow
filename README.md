# DineNow 

# The Project is in the Bransh called "Master"

## A small demo is uploaded to the readMe file in the "Master" branch 

### Problem we are trying to address:
Sometimes when we go out at night, we donâ€™t have an idea of how busy the restaurant is, or can it accommodate that many people, or are we going to have a nice cozy place for our romantic date. It may also take a long time for the food to be ready or some signature dishes might be unavailable that night. Those situations can easily ruin a good night and the experience at the restaurant. We want to help both customers and restaurants. 


### Our Solution: 
An app that would allow the user to reserve the table of their choice at a restaurant as well as let the user see the seats available in real time. Furthermore, the app would allow the user to select their meal to be prepared by the time they arrive. This will also let the restaurants know how busy they will potentially be for that day.
